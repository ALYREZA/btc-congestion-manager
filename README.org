 https://github.com/bitcoinjs/coinselect/blob/master/stats/strategies.js
 


** fee estimator
- mempool fee distribution
- last few blocks fee distribution
- n txs in mempool
- rate of change of n txs in mempool
- create time distribution functions
- pick fees that will get txs in on average after 3 blocks, using RBF and 95% CI cumsum at say 6 blocks
