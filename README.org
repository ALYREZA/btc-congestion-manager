  - we rewrite x = x_0 + vt into x_0 = x - vt, where $$x_0$$ is the initial
    position [B], x is the finalPosition [B], $$v$$ is velocity in [B/10
    min] and t is time in [10 min]
  - all txs are sorted according to weight of the whole branch involving all
    its decendents
  - we calculate how many transactions are added ahead of a target block to
    estimate velocity (estimate comes from the past hour)
  - we assume probability of finding a new block at any time is constant.
  - we use the sorted list of txs to determing x. knowing $$x$$ and $vt$ we can
    calculate x_0
  - we look up the feeRate paid by the tx closest to where x_0 falls and use
    that feeRate to estimate velocity.
